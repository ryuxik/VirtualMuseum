                    Interactions with our collections are restricted to those who acquire one of the
                    finite number of experience passes, which can be acquired in 2 ways. The first
                    is via inital offerings through our scheduled auctions. The second is via the pass marketplace,
                    where pass owners can to trade or sell passes from past collections. A fraction of the proceeds
                    from each auction, pass trade, and pass sale is passed on to the artist and musem to support
                    both throughout the lifespan of the collection.

                    Through our action house, artists are also able to sell their control over their collections.
                    The controller of a collection has the right to collect proceeds from future pass trades and sales.
